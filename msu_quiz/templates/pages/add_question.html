          Enter all questions and answers in a single document. <br> Put a number, followed by a . or ) and space before each question. The numbers do not have to be in any order, and can repeat. <br> After the end of the question, a single enter.</p>
        <p class="text-danger"> The first multiple choice must be the answer!</p>
        <p class="text-success">
          Each multiple choice needs to start with a letter, followed by a . or ) followed by at least one space or tab. You can use the same MCQ letter multiple times, they have no function besides letting my script know it is still looking at MCQ's and not the next question. <br>
          <br> Questions can be as long as you want. You can also have as many multiple choices as you want. <br> Because of the way my script parses your input, you cannot use multiple choice in the form of "Both A and B". Your input will have all numbers and MCQ letters scrubbed off so that choices can be randomized. <br>
          <br> There is an example in the quiz entry form. </p>
